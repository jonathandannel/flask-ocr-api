# A cross platform iOS/Android app that allows users to read and process text from images

## Features

- Image processing is done server side on a remote Python microservice, so the app loads quickly and is small in size
- Multiple language support
- Users can pick images from their camera roll, take a photo with their camera, or paste in a remote link to an image

## Screenshots

## TODO:

- Create docker container for building client APKs/deploying API
- Add multiple language `tessdata` to pytesseract path in API container
